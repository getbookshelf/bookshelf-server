# Installing bookshelf-server

This document will describe how to install bookshelf-server manually. For now, it will only contain some notes and list the requirements though.

## TLS encryption
We force all traffic to Bookshelf installations to be TLS-encrypted. This is currently implemented via a .htaccess file.
The user has to enable mod_rewrite and have the server listen for HTTPS requests. An valid certificate is recommended but not necessary.

Currently, all traffic is redirected to HTTPS. Once we implement an install script, we want to exclude that from the redirect in order to be able to show a help message to users that don't have HTTPS configured properly.

## File permissions
The following permissions have to be set in order for Bookshelf to run correctly:
    chmod -R 777 cache          // TODO: cache directory shouldn't be public!
    chmod -R 777 library
    chmod 770 config.ini

## HTML Purifier
For sanitizing HTML user inputs, we use HTML Purifier (http://htmlpurifier.org/). This package currently has to be in the user's path (will later be customizable through a config option). The easiest way of achieving this is by using PEAR:

    pear channel-discover htmlpurifier.org
    pear install hp/HTMLPurifier

HTML Purifier can and should be updated regularly:

    pear upgrade hp/HTMLPurifier
